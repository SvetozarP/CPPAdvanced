## 🚧 Status

**Work in Progress** - This repository is actively being updated as I progress through the course. New exercises and solutions will be added regularly.

## 💻 Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (Visual Studio, GCC, or Clang)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms

## 🏃 Running the Solutions

Each exercise can be compiled and run independently:

1. Navigate to the specific exercise directory
2. Compile the `.cpp` file using your preferred C++ compiler
3. Run the executable

### Example (using Visual Studio):
- Open the `.slnx` solution file in Visual Studio
- Build and run the project

### Example (using command line):
```bash
g++ 01reverseString.cpp -o 01reverseString
./01reverseString
```
