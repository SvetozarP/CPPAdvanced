# C++ Advanced - SoftUni Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from the **C++ Advanced** course at SoftUni. The course covers advanced C++ programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is part of the SoftUni programming curriculum and focuses on advanced C++ topics including:
- Advanced data structures (stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Algorithm implementation and optimization
- STL (Standard Template Library) usage
- Memory management
- Advanced C++ features and best practices

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topics, with each topic containing multiple exercises:

```
CPP Advanced/
├── 01StackAndQueue/
│   ├── 01reverseString/
│   │   └── 01reverseString.cpp
│   ├── 02stackSum/
│   │   └── 02stackSum.cpp
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each exercise is contained in its own directory with:
- **Source code** (`.cpp` files)
- **Visual Studio project files** (`.vcxproj`, `.vcxproj.filters`, etc.)

## 🚧 Status

**Work in Progress** - This repository is actively being updated as I progress through the course. New exercises and solutions will be added regularly.

## 💻 Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (Visual Studio, GCC, or Clang)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms

## 🏃 Running the Solutions

Each exercise can be compiled and run independently:

1. Navigate to the specific exercise directory
2. Compile the `.cpp` file using your preferred C++ compiler
3. Run the executable

### Example (using Visual Studio):
- Open the `.slnx` solution file in Visual Studio
- Build and run the project

### Example (using command line):
```bash
g++ 01reverseString.cpp -o 01reverseString
./01reverseString
```

## 📝 Topics Covered

- [x] Stack and Queue
- [ ] (More topics will be added as the course progresses)

## 📖 Notes

- Solutions are implemented as part of my learning journey
- Code may be optimized or refactored as I learn better practices
- Some exercises may be incomplete or have room for improvement
